            natural beauty. From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the serene temples of Kyoto, Japan offers a unique blend of tradition and modernity. Visitors can explore ancient castles, indulge in world-class cuisine, and

        <h2 id="location">Geographical Location</h2> 
        <p id="p-abt-location">Japan is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, off the eastern coast of Asia. It consists of four
            main islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—as well as numerous smaller islands. Japan is situated
            to the east of the Korean Peninsula and China, and to the north of Taiwan. The country is known for its
            mountainous terrain, with over 70% of its land covered by mountains. Japan's geographical location makes it
            prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity, but it also boasts beautiful landscapes, including cherry blossom
            trees, hot springs, and scenic coastlines.</p>
